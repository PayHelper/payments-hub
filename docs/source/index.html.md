# Introduction

Welcome to the Payments Hub API! You can use our API to access Payments Hub API endpoints, which can get information on various payments, payment methods, orders checkouts etc. in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: key"
```

> Make sure to replace `key` with your API key.
